            <p class="font-small align-left">
                Leap has Fully-Managed Resource Management Architecture. It is dividing resources for two category which is consisted with Memory Resources and File Resources.<br>
                Memory Resources contributes for processing more fast response and huge amount of request. And File Resources be used for big size data response or non critical of fast response as well.
                If system has plenty of memory resource, It can be service for On-Demand contents service and Realtime Streaming service like OTT or Video platform e.g. Netflex, Youtube.<br>
                In-Memory Resources can be having huge size, as a matter of fact, file size isn't important if the system physical memory is enough because of it's managing the file by splited parts on List.<br>
                Resource Manager provides whole content of In-Memory resource by the mechanism to reassembling each part of it. Controversially, Registering to In-Memory resource process is worked to split to many part of it if it's size over the part size.<br>
                Also Resource Manager has proper filters to manage resources to secure and ensure.<br>
                Administrator can register filter set in configuration of Leap for allowed resources and forbidden resource to be more secure and ensure to managed resources.<br>
                Resource Manager provides various functionalities for supporting to combine between requested context and real resources and client can be took resources by just requesting URL on browser or others.<br>
